                        <p>Dearest Reader,</p>

                        <p>
                          This is Lalit, and this will be the first of, hopefully, many entries I make on this feed.
                          I intend to eventually use this feed to link to other stuff I am doing, but for now it will
                          serve as a timeline for the construction of this website.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          I have often found that the process is often more important than the result. I want this feed
                          to serve as a look inside my brain.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          If you are reading this, you are either a friend I have forced to read my site, or a potential
                          employer who saw my site on my resume.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          At this moment, this website consists of roughly 100 lines of code and is extremely primitive.
                          I have thoughts on what I want to do here, and I want to document them now.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          I know that the final product will be very different from what I imagine, but I hope that the
                          difference between the vision stated below and what you see on your screen will serve as a
                          journal of what I have learned.
                        </p>

                        <p>Anyway, here are my plans:</p>

                        <ul style="margin-top: 1rem; padding-left: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.6;">
                          <li>
                            I <strong>need</strong> a better way to insert updates into the feed. At the moment, I am typing
                            this directly into the HTML file in VS Code, and while it works (however inefficiently) for now,
                            I think I will move to a better system soon.
                            <br><br>
                            An Obsidian plugin that takes my notes and posts them here directly could be fun. I already use
                            plugins in Obsidian to sync my Kindle highlights to my vault
                            (<a href="https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">obsidian-kindle-plugin</a>),
                            and that plugin has inspired me.
